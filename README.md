## Quick Start
```bash
yarn add tomorrowjs
```
or
``` bash
npm install tomorrowjs
```

## What is it?

**Tomorrow.JS** is a react-native ecosystem that provides a set of tools to help you build your app faster and easier. Think of it like **Tomorrow.JS** is a **React-Native** on steroids.
**Tomorrow.JS** is the equivalent of **Next.JS** for **React-Native**.

## Our Aim

We aim to create an environment where people from any react background can easily create a react-native application. We want to bring the idea of modular react-native applications to the next level.

## Why Tomorrow.JS?

**Tomorrow.JS** has a few differentiators that make it stand out from the rest of the react-native ecosystems. We do not try to hide what we do. There are no pay walls, no off-site builds. We provide the tools and the environment for you to thrive. Everything is open source and free to use. Everything you need is here.
